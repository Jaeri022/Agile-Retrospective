# Agile-Retrospective

#How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User needs gets evaluated before a sprit durig sprint planning ad goes into a product backlog as "user stories". These user stories are ranked based off priority and sets small goals on how to complete a project. They help by explaining what features should go into a project without needing to specify how these features are accomplished.

#How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

The good thing about the agile approach is that it is done in short sprints rather than over a long period of time. This is benefitial because it allows for changes to be reacted to more quickly without havig to scrap a project entirely, and allows to also reflect on what went right and wrong within a sprint. 

#What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I feel being a team member not only meas beig able to accomplish the tasks needed to complete a project, but also help out other team members for any hinderences they may have and also ask for help whenever you yourself is stuck accomplishing a certain task. It also helps to put input into a project (especially during the planning stage) about any insecurities you may have before beginning to work.
